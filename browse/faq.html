        <h2>When I say "Frequently asked questions" I don't mean to answer questions you have,
            these are questions that will be asked of you
            should you consult your friendly neighbourhood tech wizard because more often than you'd think.
            The answer is no and then magically everything fixes when you do/check everything off this list</h2>

        <h2>Have you tried turning it off and on again?</h2>
        <p>Yes really... Just do it... It's like coffee to the computer gremlins</p>

        <h2>Did you plug it in?</h2>
        <p>Yes really... You'd be surprised how often this one gets people</p>
        
        <h2>Whatever you did before it stopped working, can you undo whatever it was?</h2>
        <p>Not every button needs pressing, and every button pressed needs an undo</p>

        <h2>Have you clicked the "forgot my password" or "reset my password" button?</h2>
        <p>Have your handy dandy email ready for this one</p>

        <h2>Are you able to access the problem?</h2>
        <p>If the problems with the computer, are you at the desk?<br><br>
            Problem with the printer, can you get to the printer?<br><br>
            The IT person can't just magically access anything remotely (though we kinda wish we could)<br><br>
            But for now, you are likely our eyes and hands for fixing things... God help us...
